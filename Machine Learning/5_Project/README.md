# Final Project

## About

This project is prepared by:

- **Group Member 1**: Nur Damia Binti Rohisyam (Student ID: 1211304435)
- **Group Member 2**: Faqihah Binti Zakir (Student ID: 1211303109)
- **Group Member 3**: Muhammad Zafri Bin Marwan (Student ID: 1201101871)

## Objective of Our Project

The objective of this lab is to predict housing prices based on key factors such as property type, furnishing status, and location. We aim to apply the techniques learned in class, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Regression, and Neural Networks, to develop and evaluate our predictive models.

## Dataset Description

- **Link**: [Raw Malaysian Housing Prices Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcpenguin/raw-malaysian-housing-prices-data)
- **File**: houses.csv
- **Description**: The dataset consists of prices for various Malaysian condominiums, scraped from mudah.my, with 4000 rows and 32 columns describing the properties.

## Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning**: All group members contributed to the data cleaning process to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
- **PCA Analysis**: Conducted by Nur Damia Binti Rohisyam.
- **Linear Regression**: Conducted by Faqihah Binti Zakir.
- **Neural Networks**: Conducted by Muhammad Zafri Bin Marwan.
- **Model Comparison**: Collaborative effort by all group members to compare the performance of the different models.

## Getting Started

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - We began by cleaning the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies.
   
2. **PCA Analysis**:
   - Principal Component Analysis was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify the most significant features.

3. **Linear Regression**:
   - A linear regression model was developed to predict housing prices based on the cleaned dataset.

4. **Neural Networks**:
   - A neural network model was also developed and trained to improve prediction accuracy.

5. **Model Comparison**:
   - Finally, we compared the performance of the different models using various evaluation metrics.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `5_Project` folder.
3. Open `5_Project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the notebook cells to see the data cleaning, PCA, Linear Regression, Neural Networks, and model comparison steps in action.
