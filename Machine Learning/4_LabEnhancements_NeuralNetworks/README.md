## Objective

In this notebook, we'll go through the code to create your very first neural network to predict whether the house price is below or above median value.

## Dataset Description

The dataset we will use today is adapted from Zillow’s Home Value Prediction Kaggle competition data. We’ve reduced the number of input features and changed the task into predicting whether the house price is above or below median value.

## Requirements

- Python's Tensorflow library is required to in order run the notebook.
